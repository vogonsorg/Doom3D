Compiling Doom3D
----------------

The included makefile is for the Borland compiler, it should work with Borland
C++5, C++ builder, and the free downloadable borland compiler. obj
files are created in ..\obj\, and the exe/dll is created in ..\ this should be
easily changable by editing the first few lines of the makefile.


I have also compiled Doom3D with MS VC++6, to do this you'll have to create
your own project files. The following files make up each of the projects:

target Doom3d.exe:
am_*.c
c_interface.c
co_console.c
d_*.c
f_*.c
g_*.c
hu_*.c
i_input.c
i_main.c
i_music.c
i_net.c
i_reg.c
i_system.c
i_sound.c
i_windoz.c
m_*.c
p_*.c
s_*.c
sp_*.c
st_*.c
w_*.c
wi_*.c
z_*.c
info.c
sounds.c

target c_sw8.dll
dllmain.c
i_gamma.c
i_overlay.c
tables.c
m_fixed.c
m_swap.c
c_sw.c
swr_*.c
sw8*.c
c_dll.def

target c_sw16.dll
dllmain.c
i_gamma.c
i_overlay.c
tables.c
m_fixed.c
m_swap.c
c_sw.c
swr_*.c
sw16*.c
c_dll.def

target c_d3d.dll
dllmain.c
i_gamma.c
i_overlay.c
tables.c
m_fixed.c
m_swap.c
c_d3d.c
d3d*.c
c_dll.def

target=setup.exe
setup.c
i_reg.c
m_keys.c

target=compwad.exe  //console app
compwad.c
i_reg.c
m_keys.c

I haven't included all the header files here, but VC should work them out
automaticaly the first time you compile.
