Doom3D Todo - ** before next release
-----------

- cheats via. cosole.

- cvars, eg autorun, and cheats

- organise+prioratize todo list

- console command autocomplete

- cd music

- mouselook/full 3D control

- maybe consider pre-parse command names - problems if client/server?

- fix selective redraw on statusbar

- KEY_EQUALS?

- fix held down keys during console, possibly just release all keys when console opened

- fix music volume control

- fix netgame duplicate packet detection

- boom support

- redo controls setup

- rearrange netgame setup dialog

- jumping

- rewrite network code, preferably as client/server

- automap in splitscreen and d3d

- allow more than 4 players

- redo memory subsystem to allow dynamic allocation. Probly similar, but allocate in (eg.) 1Mb chunks as needed

- Some sort of PVS system to speed up rendering(possibly 'steal' code from quake vis util?)
  Need help/thory - Maybe get someone else to do this!

- switch to DX7 + use vertex buffers for rendering - prolly get DX7 SDK help first

- detect out of texture mem. during precache (quicker)

- make sky 'solid' like it is on original(may be unneccesary with decent PVS)

- seperate (possibly interpreted) game module

- Automap in HW-accel

- Fix screen wipes in 16bit and d3d modes, preferably with hw-accel

- zdoom compatability

- transparent Automap - overlay surface?
